# BlueGorilla
Fork of the [Iceape-UXP Internet Suite](https://wiki.hyperbola.info/doku.php?id=en:project:iceape-uxp).

## Differences from Iceape-UXP
* TODO: All build dependencies in one repository. No need to Download Icedove-UXP source code then put Iceape-UXP inside of that.
* TODO: Patches ported from [Binary Outcast's browser and email applications](https://github.com/binaryoutcast/binoc-central).
* TODO: Compatibility with both SeaMonkey and Iceape-UXP GUIDs for addons.
* TODO: New branding.
* TODO (very low priority): Fix compiler warnings when possible on as many compilers as possible.
* TODO: Patches ported from upstream Iceape-UXP as well as [Icedove-UXP](https://wiki.hyperbola.info/doku.php?id=en:project:icedove-uxp).
* TODO: Fix issues when building Lightning calendar extension. Currently you have to install the .xpi after building.

## Patches to UXP
There will be .patch files that should be applied before building in the patches directory
