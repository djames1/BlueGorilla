# Compatible Addons 
Below is a list of some of the addons that are compatible with BlueGorilla and Iceape-UXP

* [Classic Add-ons Archive](https://github.com/JustOff/ca-archive/)
** Important: None of the addons will work without being ported first
* [Cookies Exterminator](https://github.com/JustOff/cookies-exterminator)
* [HTTPS Always](https://repo.palemoon.org/Hyperbola/https-always)
* [HTTPS Inquirer](https://repo.palemoon.org/Hyperbola/httpsinquirer)
* [PDF.js](https://github.com/IsaacSchemm/pdf.js-seamonkey/)
* [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock-for-firefox-legacy)
* [UXP Vertical Tab Bar](https://github.com/djames1/UXPVerticalTabBar)
* [Î·Matrix](https://gitlab.com/vannilla/ematrix)

Eventually I will host a version of the modified SeaMonkey addons converter that will convert addons to be BlueGorilla/IceApe-UXP compatible.
